**Set up**

To run this app make sure that npm is installed on your device(https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

**Start the app**

Run the following commands one by one:

1. npm install
2. gulp start

If I had more time

1. Handle the slow load of data when the app starts
2. Add further protections for if the API changes and retrieves unexpected data
3. More comprehensive unit tests
4. End to end testing with protractor
